rtNEATbox[1] is a simple neuro-evolution sandbox. Two-dimensional levels can be
created, in which a group of organisms are simulated. The goal is for the
organisms to navigate the terrain to reach a certain goal point. rtNEAT[2] is
used for the neuro-evolution of the organisms. Physics simulation is provided
by Box2D[3].

In order to compile, Box2D and GLUT will need to be installed. Under
Ubuntu/Debian this can be achieved by installing the libbox2d-dev and
freeglut-dev packages. Then run `make` to compile.
